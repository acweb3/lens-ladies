			"November in the Canadian Rockies brings snow capped peaks and quiet lakes as the weather continues to cool and tourists are far and few between.  This is a special time of year for locals and one of my favorite times to capture imagery close to home.   An evening paddle is interrupted only by the sound of rippling water as oar strokes cut through the lake like glass. A twinkle of distant town lights and soft murmurings from friends by the shore, this is how we close our days and welcome the night. I created this image by combining the peaceful scene of a late evening kayak, with an image taken of the northern lights overhead later that same night.   A scene that represents the dreamer in me and the sense of calm and overwhelming inspiration I find when photographing moments within the outdoors. ",

The temperatures are pleasant and dramatic shooting conditions are common.  People from all over the world flock here to photograph this special time of the year.  It’s always an unreal opportunity when an early season snow storm rolls in, usually late September and blankets the landscape in a coat of white.  In contrast with the fall colors, this becomes a paradise for photography. The two seasons, winter and autumn must collide at the right time.   This evening I was lucky to witness this, capture a self-portrait and have calm winds which kept the lake as smooth as glass! It’s like walking into a dream. ",

			"Dream your dreams with open eyes and make them come true.~ T. E. Lawrence  Ever have one of those scenes you dream about? This was it for me. I have always dreamed of going to Iceland and standing in front of Skógafoss waterfall under an aurora filled sky!  In 2013,  I went on a trip of a lifetime with a photo tour to Iceland, 2 weeks of incredible scenery and unfortunately, cloudy moody skies and a winter storm packing 180 km/hr winds! However, sometimes you just have to make the best out of what you are given. Our wonderful group enjoyed our lemonade on the black sand beaches being pelted with winds and snow shooting glaciers and getting unique shots.  Since my dream of an Iceland - waterfall - aurora shot never came to fruition, I created it!  I did this by combining a beautiful moment from my visit to Iceland and one of the most incredible aurora shows from this past November from my driveway in Manitoba, Canada!   Welcome to my Iceland Aurora Waterfall Dream! I hope you get lost in the beauty of the moment, hear the roar of the waterfall and feel the peace of standing under incredible skies in a beautiful foreign land!  ",
